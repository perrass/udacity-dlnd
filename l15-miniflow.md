## Mini-Flow

**A neural network is a *graph* of mathematical functions such as linear combination and activate functions**. A node could represent $f(x, y) = x + y$ 

* By propagating values from the first layer through all the mathematical functions represented by each node, the network outputs a value. This process is called a **forward pass**
